# Vending-Machine

A simple "vending machine" program that lets the user select items from a vending machine (provided the quantity of the item is greater than zero.

The user will be shown a greeting and the name, value and quantity of available items. Then they will be prompted to choose which item to take.

I also added a mechanic where the user inputs how much money they have and that amount is deducted for every purchase (until the user does not have enough money to purchase more, in which case the program exits). This was to practice making extra additions to a project beyond the base goals. 

# Goal of Project
This project is for me to practice Object Oriented Programming in Java. It is also a way for me to practice making regular commits as I proceed with the creation of this project. 

# Project source
This challenge/program is from the Complete Java Development Bootcamp on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-java-development-bootcamp/
The course provided the "WELCOME TO JAVA DRINKS!" header as well as some commented prompts and hints for the Machine object's dispense function and the 2D array of items. The rest of the code is mine
